	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	Bug: If the main file ($1 if (.*).latexmain) is opened with vim, vim
	     hangs itself up when opening other tex files in the same document.  To
	     reproduce:

	        $ mkdir /tmp/latexhang
	        $ cd !$
	        $ touch a.tex a.tex.latexmain b.tex
	        $ screen -dm vim a.tex
	        $ vim b.tex
	        [...]

	     Some times, a ctrl-c enables the editing of b.tex.
	     (Martin Krafft)
	Why: ``screen -dm vim a.tex`` creates a .a.vim.swp file. In
	     Tex_pack_updateall(), there is a ``split a.tex`` which makes vim put
	     up the standard, "choose what to do" prompt. Unfortunately, this is
	     not seen by the user. Therefore it looks like things have hung.
	Fix: Use ``sview a.tex`` instead of ``split a.tex``.

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	Bug: When the open and close quote patterns contain the \ character, then
	     the qoute completion fails. Pressing " always inserts the open quote
	     string.
	Fix: Escape the Tex_SmartQuoteOpen and Tex_SmartQuoteClose while searching
	     backwards.

	Description of the g:Bib_{type}_extrafields option.

2004-08-04 18:48  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/bibtex.vim:

	New: Allow even more user customization of the fields for each bibliography
	     type. This is because presently the user is limited to the options
	     defined by the s:_{letter}_standsfor variables (Thomas Link).

2004-07-21 17:41  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite-quickstart.xml, latex-suite.txt,
	  latex-suite.xml:

	New: Updated documentation of the Tex_ViewRuleComplete_format variable.

2004-07-21 12:01  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/brackets.vim:

	Bug: The bracketing maps <M-[bcl]> only worked on the first buffer which
	     triggers latex-suite.
	Why: Initially brackets.vim resided in ftplugin/tex/, where it got sourced
	     every time, but when it was moved to ftplugin/latex-suite, where it
	     gets sourced only once.
	Fix: Catch the LatexSuiteFileType event

2004-06-19 13:15  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: compiler.vim, main.vim:

	Bug: On windows, viewing doesn't work because we have changed the way the
	     program is called (basically the extension is not used) (Luc Hermitte)
	Fix: revert back to the original way of calling the external program

	New: Also check for Tex_ViewRuleComplete_{format} when finding out whether
	     a given target specified in TTarget is legal.

2004-06-18 17:50  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: compiler.vim, main.vim:

	Bug: The trick of
	        let &mp = Tex_ViewRuleComplete_{format}
	        silent! make
	     doesn't work for many windows programs which try to interpret the
	     trailing redirection string and therefore choke saying that the file
	     is not found.
	Fix: Therefore following Luc Hermitte's advice, come up with an imitation
	     of Vim's 'makeprg' which just executes the string. For now, this code
	     is in Tex_ViewLaTeX, but in the future, it could be a seperate helper
	     function.

2004-06-18 17:15  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: custommacros.vim, main.vim:

	Bug: Entering a template via the :TMacro command doesn't work.
	Why: We use Tex_FindInRtp(fname, 'macro') which returns only the last part
	     of the full path name.
	Fix: Use Tex_FindInRtp(fname, 'macro', ':p') instead.

2004-06-18 16:59  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: compiler.vim, main.vim, texrc:

	New: A new setting Tex_ShowErrorContext which if set to 0, will not show
	     the preview window beneath the list of errors.

2004-06-18 16:13  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: compiler.vim, main.vim, texrc:

	New: An option Tex_ViewRuleComplete_{format} which allows more complete
	     control for the user to customize the viewer program.
	     Tex_ViewRule_{format} only worked if the program accepted the file to
	     be viewed as the last argument.

	     Suppose you have a latex->html converter which converts a file say
	     foo.tex to a file foo/index.html. Then you would use:

	         let g:Tex_ViewRuleComplete_html = 'MozillaFirebird $*/index.html &'

	     Doing something like this would not be possible using
	     Tex_ViewRule_html

2004-06-16 20:32  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: compiler.vim, main.vim:

	Bug: In windows, searching from a file which is included into the main
	     file but lies in a subdirectory under the main file doesn't work. i.e,
	     if you have

	        main.tex
	            \include{subdirectory/file.tex}

	     and you open subdirectory/file.tex and perform \ls from there, then it
	     doesn't work.
	Why: Used the source position as expand('%:p:t') which doesn't work if the
	     file in which we are searching doesn't lie in the same directory as
	     the main file.
	Fix: Use expand('%') instead which automatically provides a relative path.
	     TODO: Should we have used Tex_RelPath from texviewer.vim to also
	     handle cases where the included file lies above the main file? Highly
	     improbable of course...

2004-06-13 11:12  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: main.vim, texrc, texviewer.vim:

	Bug: Typing a <bs> in insert mode triggers the error:
	     >>Error detected while processing
	     >>function <SNR> 25_SmartBS:
	     >>
	     >>line 2:
	     >>
	     >>E55: Unmatched \\)
	     (Alp ATICI)
	Why: A faulty move of code from main.vim to texrc.

2004-06-09 13:47  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	New: A global versioning system for Latex-suite which will be helpful in
	     making sure users have the correct version etc.

2004-06-09 10:02  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	Bug: Get an error
	     E117: Unknown function: Tex_GetVarValue
	Why: We use Tex_GetVarValue before it is defined.
	Fix: Move the smart key functions below the "helper" functions. The helper
	     functions should always be defined before any other function which
	     might use them.

2004-06-06 16:21  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: compiler.vim, main.vim, texrc:

	New: Make the program for creating the .ind file customizable via the
	     Tex_MakeIndexFlavor. (requested by Berta Milan)

	New: Make the pattern used to detect diacritics customizable via the
	     Tex_SmartBSPattern (requested by Berta Milan)

2004-05-30 00:35  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	Bug: Typing
	     >>> \begin{array}
	     >>>    \end{}
	     results in
	     >>> \begin{array}
	     >>> \end{<++>}
	     with the cursor at the end (Berta Milan)
	Why: When the indentation of a line changes while typing the text returned
	     by IMAP_PutTextWithMovement, then IMAP_Mark('go') does not go to the
	     same location as set by IMAP_Mark('set'). This causes the cursor to be
	     located not before the first placeholder causing the first
	     placeholder to be "missed".
	Fix: Check to see if the indentation of the line remembered by
	     IMAP_Mark('set') has changed and if so, move a little to the left or
	     right to adjust for the indentation changing.

2004-05-25 11:51  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	Bug: <F7> for inserting commands doesn't work in Insert mode and works
	     buggily in Normal mode.
	Why: Used <cword> to extract the word under the cursor which doesn't work
	     if the cursor is just past the end of a word. This is a common
	     occurence when <F7> is pressed just after typing a word. Also in
	     normal mode, just used the part of the word which is before the
	     cursor.
	Fix: Use matchstr(getline('.'), '\w\+$') to extract the word before the
	     cursor. This works even after the end of a word in insert mode.

2004-05-21 18:25  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	New: Factory defaults for a few more variables which were introduced
	     recently.

2004-05-21 18:24  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	New: Tex_GetVarValue now doesn't accept a second argument as the default
	     but just returns '' if no variable with the name exists. This means
	     that factory defaults for all variables _have_ to be provided in texrc
	     henceforth.

2004-05-21 18:21  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texproject.vim:

	Bug: The .latexmain file is only sourced on the first file which is opened.
	Why: We did not catch the LatexSuiteFileType event
	Fix: Catch the LatexSuiteFileType event and source the master file for
	     every file opened. Basically, the .latexmain file acts like a
	     project specific ftplugin file.

	New: Removed a lot of code from old which seems to be no longer used.
	     Unless we actually change things around to once again use g:projFiles
	     etc, it looks like this is just not doing anything.

2004-05-21 17:26  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	New: A refactoring of code to use Tex_GetVarValue instead of using g:Tex_*
	     variables. Basically, this makes it possible for the user to more
	     finely tune the behavior of latex-suite on a per-project basis.
	     As of now, most settings of latex-suite are handled by setting
	     global variables like g:Tex_UseMakeFile. In the future, we should set
	     "factory defaults" in texrc by setting g:Tex_* variables. After that,
	     we should always use Tex_GetVarValue to query the value of the
	     variable. This allows the user to over-ride the factory default at a
	     variety of levels, for example:
	     1. If the user defines g:Tex_* in ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex.vim, then he
	        will over-ride the setting for all files.
	     2. If he defines b:Tex_* in a project master file, for instance, if he
	        sets
	            let b:Tex_UseMakeFile = 0
	        in one .latexmain file, then only .tex files which source that
	        .latexmain file will not use the makefile. Other files will
	        continue to use the makefile.

2004-05-19 18:09  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texviewer.vim:

	New: Instead of always using the complex logic of searching for \\label's
	     in the main file and all \input'ed file, provide a setting which
	     enables the user to simply search all the .tex files in the current
	     directory as before.

2004-05-18 15:23  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Bug: When the format dependency chain is interrupted in the middle, then
	     the default target format is changed the next time we compile, i.e, if
	        g:Tex_DefaultTargetFormat = 'ps'
	        g:Tex_FormatDependency_ps = 'dvi,ps'
	     and there is an error in the ->dvi step, then the next time, if the
	     error is removed, Tex_RunLaTeX stops after the ->dvi step.
	Why: s:target is changed when Tex_RunLaTeX interrupts the build process.
	Fix: When there are errors and the build process needs to be interrupted,
	     then reset the default target format.

2004-05-16 11:42  srinathava

	* doc/latex-suite.xml:

	New: documentation for the new functionality of completing \ref's.

2004-05-16 10:41  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Bug: Part compilation doesn't work because the temporary file created does
	     not include the preamble of the original main file.
	Why: We used Tex_GetMainFileName(':p:r') from before the time
	     Tex_GetMainFileName was changed.
	Fix: Use Tex_GetMainFileName(':p') instead.

2004-05-16 10:38  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texviewer.vim:

	New: Instead of searching for \\label's in all the .tex files in the
	     present directory, only search in the mainfile and all the included
	     files.

2004-05-14 10:37  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Bug: Sometimes, even if there are errors in compiling the .tex file,
	     Tex_RunLaTeX proceeds to convert to ps, etc.
	Why: The pattern used to check whether there is an error lin the :clist is
	     very restrictive. If there are errors which do not have an associated
	     line number, then the pattern doesn't match and we fail to detect that
	     there is an error.
	Fix: Just use very simple patterns.

2004-05-14 10:33  srinathava

	* compiler/tex.vim:

	Bug: If an error is of the form
	     >> ! Missing $ inserted.
	     >> <inserted text>
	     >>                 $
	     >> l.9
	     >>
	     >> I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
	     >> you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.
	     (there's a single <space> after l.9), then the line number is not
	     recognized.
	Why: The 'efm' setting contains only '%+Cl.%l\ %m', which means that the
	     line number is recognized only when the "l.<number><space>" is
	     followed by a message.
	Fix: Append '%+Cl.%l\ ' to the 'efm'.

2004-05-09 15:43  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texviewer.vim:

	Bug: The <F9> mapping only works on the first .tex file which triggers
	     latex-suite. (Julien)
	Why: When we were moving texviewer.vim from ../tex/texviewer.vim to here,
	     we didn't bother to catch the LatexSuiteFileTypeEvent which is the
	     mechanism to ensure the maps get set for every .tex file opened.
	Fix: Catch the LatexSuiteFileTypeEvent event (SA)

2004-05-09 15:11  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite.xml, latex-suite.txt:

	New: Description of the <M-i> mapping to insert \item commands.

2004-05-04 13:50  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	Bug: when 'ignorecase' is set, then typing 'etB' triggers an error.
	Why: With 'ignorecase' set, 'etB' matches 'ETB', therefore, LookupCharacter
	     assumes that a map exists for 'etB' and tries to find the value of
	     s:Map_Tex_etB which doesn't exist.
	Fix: Force matching case with the \C pattern.

2004-03-15 11:40  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	New: A more precise behavior of the Tex_InsertItem function to account for
	     the fact that the previous \\begin might not be the environment in
	     which the cursor is enclosed. (Alan Schmitt)

2004-03-14 11:39  srinathava

	* plugin/remoteOpen.vim:

	Bug: RemoteOpen does not work with file names with spaces.
	Why: The following vim command
	        :drop File Name with spaces
	     opens up multiple files.
	Fix: escape() the file name before issuing the drop command.
	     NOTE: There is a vim bug where
	        exec "drop ".escape(filename, '\ ')
	     hangs GVIM.

2004-03-13 22:25  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	Bug: <M-i> is mapped to <Plug>Tex_InsertItemOnThisLine even when there is
	     some other key sequence which is mapped to
	     <Plug>Tex_InsertItemOnThisLine.
	Why: hasmapto() uses "nvo" as the default. Therefore, checking for the
	     existence of an insert mode mapping without supplying the mode
	     argument is faulty.
	Fix: Supply "i" as the mode argument.

2003-12-18 19:06  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/templates.vim:

	Bug: When the user's 'fo' setting had 'ro' included in it, then inserting
	     templates would result in strange leading indentation (it would be
	     doubled etc).
	Why: IMAP_PutTextWithMovement simulates key-presses. Therefore if 2
	     successive lines in the template begin with ``%`` and ``'fo'`` has
	     ``ro``, then the second line will have an extra ``%`` character.
	Fix: Set ``'fo'`` temporarily to an empty string.

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	Bug: loading templates no longer works.
	Why: Apparently if one is editing a file, say file.tex which is modified,
	     then one cannot do ":split file.tex"
	Fix: Only split a window if the main file name is not the current file.
	     TODO: What happens if the main file is being opened in a seperate
	           window and is modified?

2003-12-16 15:41  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	Bug: \cite completion did not work. The prefix was not honored and
	     therefore all the matches would be shown and moreover the text would
	     not be inserted properly.
	Cause: We had used the pattern::
				let s:prefix = matchstr(s:prefix, '\([^,]\+,\)\+\zs\([^,]\+\)\ze$')
	       to modify the prefix. However, this only succeeds when there are
	       more than 1 items in the \cite. i.e, \cite{key1,pre. s:prefix
	       becomes empty if we do try to complete just \cite{pre
	Fix: Change the prefix to::
				let s:prefix = matchstr(s:prefix, '\([^,]\+,\)*\zs\([^,]\+\)\ze$')

2003-12-16 13:27  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/templates/IEEEtran.tex:

	Bug: IEEEtran.tex template inserted needless indentation. There was also an
	     extra ``\begin{document}`` and some mismatched curly braces.

	Please follow the following guidelines henceforth in creating templates:

	1. The first placeholder in the template should be an empty placeholder
	   As of now, vim does not provide the equivalent of a "startinsert"
	   command for leaving in visual mode.

	2. There should not be any indentation in the file. For example, if the
	   template contains a ``\begin{eqnarray}``, it should be written as::

	        \begin{eqnarray}
	        <+write equation here+>
	        \end{eqnarray}

	   instead of::

	        \begin{eqnarray}
	            <+write equation here+>
	        \end{eqnarray}

	   ``IMAP_PutTextWithMovement`` automatically inserts the correct
	   indentation according to the user's ``'sw'`` and other indent settings.

	3. No trailing empty lines after the ``\end{document}``.

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/templates.vim:

	Bug: When g:Imap_PlaceHolderStart and/or g:Imap_PlaceHolderEnd settings
	     were not ascii and encoding=utf8, then reading in a template did not
	     work as advertised (placeholders are shown as <ab><bb> etc)
	Why: templates.vim still used simple pattern substitution to replace the
	     placeholder characters, which does not work in the above setting.
	Fix: Use IMAP_PutTextWithMovement which handles the above situation.

2003-12-16 11:43  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	Recently, I had to fix a bug in packages.vim which made vim quit as soon as
	it was open. Since I couldn't use the Tex_PrintDebug() function, I made a
	little change which created a log file in the /tmp directory. This might be
	a useful thing to have in the future, but ofcourse, it should definitely be
	off by default.

2003-12-14 19:33  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: custommacros.vim, main.vim, packages.vim,
	  texproject.vim:

	Yet more changes in the effort to make latex-suite support file names with
	spaces. A new function ``Tex_EscapeSpaces`` which escapes spaces *only if
	necessary*. This function should henceforth be used whenever we want to
	split a new file, save a file etc etc. Example::

	    exec 'split '.Tex_EscapeSpaces(filename)

2003-12-14 16:55  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	modifications to account for the changes in Tex_EscapeForGrep().

2003-12-14 16:53  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	Change: Initially, Tex_EscapeForGrep would always double backslashes at
	        least once to account for the fact that the user means the external
	        grep command to see the string ``\\label`` when he passes
	        ``\label`` to this function. But making such guesses is bad for
	        cases when we want to pass a single ``\`` to the external grep
	        command (for instance when we want to pass ``\<word\>`` to the
	        external grep command). Therefore, stop this function from making
	        any guesses about what the user might have wanted the external
	        command to see.  This function now expects the user to pass the
	        exact string which he wants the external grep command to see.

2003-12-14 15:31  srinathava

	* ftplugin/: latex-suite/main.vim, tex/texviewer.vim:

	Change: Making Tex_EscapeForGrep more cross-platform. Use this henceforth
	        whenever a :grep command needs to be issued.

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	A few small updates to account for the change in Tex_GetMainFileName()

2003-12-13 23:20  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/folding.vim:

	New: The fold text is now also "indented". in other words, the fold text is
	     now prepended with the whitespace of the current line so that
	     nested-ness is more apparent.

2003-12-13 23:17  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Attempting to fix the filenames with spaces problem. Also since
	Tex_GetMainFileName() _always_ returns a file name now, (even if a
	.latexmain file does not exist), lots of redundant logic is now removed.

2003-12-13 23:13  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	A serious attempt at fixing the file names with spaces problems across
	various platforms.

	Change: Tex_GetMainFileName now applies the file name modifier to the
	        filename after removing the trailing .latexmain part if it exists.

	Bug: Tex_FindInRtp would return a non-empty string even if a filename is
	     not found in the &rtp.

	New: A trivial function Tex_CD() which just escapes spaces in the directory
	     name before cd'ing to it.
	     Use this function henceforth whenever you want to cd to another
	     directory instead of the
	        exec 'cd '.dirname
	     routine.

	     TODO: Maybe make this robust to detect previous attempts at escaping
	           spaces and if so, /not/ escape it again.

	Bug: Viewing did not work on certain platforms because string

	     (Alex Jakushev)

2003-12-02 03:16  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/folding.vim:

	Change: By default do not fold any commands at all. This is because the
	        start pattern for a command requires a regexp which will match
	        unbalanced parentheses of arbitrary depth. Apparently it can be
	        proved that this cannot be done with regexps.

	        Just to be on the safe side, change the start pattern for a command
	        to '^\s*\\'.name.'{[^{}]*$'. This will at least ensure that no
	        illegal folds are created. The limitation is that some legal folds
	        might also not be created.

2003-12-02 02:50  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/folding.vim:

	Change: rename FoldSections to Tex_FoldSections

	Fix: Tex_FoldSections creates a pattern like '^\s*\\'.name

2003-11-30 02:36  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/folding.vim:

	Change: Remove the comment folding from the default folding scheme.

	Change: The TexFoldTextFunction had a few problems with creating fold text
	        for comments with the : character in them. The best way seems to be
	        to just substitute the first : character with ': %'.

	New: A function Tex_MakeMap (not meant to be used by the end-user), which
	     is used to create mappings from an LHS to RHS if a mapping does not
	     exist already for RHS. basically a way to simplify writing the::

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: compiler.vim, main.vim, multicompile.vim,
	  packages.vim, pytools.py, templates.vim, texmenuconf.vim, texrc:

	A kind of big rearrangement of latex-suite is in order now that a stable
	release (1.5) has been made.

	main.vim, packages.vim, templates.vim
	Change: Tex_FindInRtp() used some pattern substitution to convert from
	        files returned by globpath to the required format. This is
	        unreliable and _very_ platform dependent. Attempting to use
	        fnamemodify() instead which takes care of such issues internally.
	        This change fixed a couple of bugs on my windows machine.

	multicompile.vim, main.vim
	Change: Functions like Tex_CatFile() etc which originally were located in
	        multicompile.vim have been moved here. The python equivalents of
	        the functions have been placed in pytools.py. multicompile.vim is
	        now effectively "empty". In the future, this file might be removed
	        from CVS. For now, I have a single "finish" in the file. This is to
	        enable a problem-free transition when this file is finally removed.

	pytools.py
	New: This file contains certain python functions to work around limitations
	     in vim scripting language. For example, there is no way in vim to read
	     the contents of a file without opening a buffer on it.

	main.vim
	New: A function Tex_GetTempName() which returns the name of a termporary
	     file in a given directory. Ideally, when compiling a fragment of a
	     file, we should create the temporary file in the same directory as the
	     original file. This function enables this to be done. The temporary
	     files thus created are removed when vim exits.

	texrc:
	New: A new setting g:Tex_RemoveTempFiles which when set to 1 (default),
	     removes temporary files created during part compilation.

	texmenuconf.vim, compiler.vim:
	Change: Add the leading Tex_ prefix to certain functions in compiler.vim to
	        make things more consistent. There are still some functions without
	        the prefix. I will make those changes gradually.

2003-10-22 18:45  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	Fix: Tex_thebibliography did not use the Tex_UseMenuWizard setting.
	     Thus <F5> completion would always ask some questions.

	Change: A little change to the Tex_InsertItem() function and the way the
	        styles for the various environments are done. In the present way,
	        we define global variables of the form:
	            g:Tex_ItemStyle_thebibliography =
	                \ '\item[<+biblabel+>]{<+bibkey+>} '
	        This is more flexible than the old approach because this way, the
	        item style can be arbitrarily complex instead of being limited to
	        one of four styles.

2003-10-09 13:59  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Fix: The original way of just doing "wincmd k" when going back to the file
	     being edited (when g:Tex_GotoError is unset) does not look robust
	     enough because we could be editing two buffers in split windows.
	     Remember the window from where we issue the RunLaTeX() function.

	Bug: Sometimes, the preview window is not properly synced.
	Why: Used 'l.'.linenum as the regexp which catches things like "l 20" as
	     well as "l.20".
	Fix: Use 'l\.'.linenum as the regexp.

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: custommacros.vim, main.vim, packages.vim,
	  templates.vim:

	This is big commit.
	In main.vim new function Tex_FileInRtp. Now we can find files for
	packages, templates and macros in all runtime directories.
	Results are different for all types. For package files it source all of
	them in order according to &rtp. In this way package files are treated
	as normal Vim plugin files and behaviour for each package can be
	modified as for ftplugin files in .vim, /usr/.../vim, and .vim/after
	directories.
	For templates it allows to see files in system-wide and local
	directories. File in the local directory with the same name as in system
	dir will overshadow system template.
	For macros basic behaviour is the same but if someone will try to
	TMacroEdit system-wide macro file will be copied to local version of
	macros dir with suffix to name '-local'. Awkward but avoids situation
	when user removes local copy of system macro and still see this macro in
	menu (and in completion of : command).
	If user choose to remove file latexSuite refuse to remove system file.

	Completion of : commands relating for packages, templates, macros. Looks
	in all &rtp directories.

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: main.vim, texrc:

	Add to main.vim definitions of tags for ctags and for texrc additional
	settings allowing for disabling this feature partially.
	Tags like TABLE OF CONTENTS, FRONTMATTER etc. allows for seeing
	structure of file. But I will not cry for it if somebody removes it :)

	Description of Tex_Com_name

2003-09-13 00:06  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	New: For the fast command insertion, if the cursor is on a <cword> then use
	     that to construct a command. Otherwise, as before, prompt for a
	     command.
	New: Utilize a new setting g:Tex_Com_{name} where name is a command name to
	     enable user customizable command completion.

2003-09-13 00:03  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	- make s:SmartDots() insert \dots instead of \cdots or \ldots if the
	  amsmath package is detected.

2003-09-12 03:29  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	New: customization of environments via new variables of the form
	     g:Tex_Env_name as described in the manual. As of now, the
	     customization only works with the first three methods (press <F5> on
	     an empty line or with a word and the <S-F1> through <S-F4> keys).
	     Making it work with things like EMA etc will take quite a bit of work
	     because there is a lot of different ways in which the 3 letter macros
	     are setup. Most of them do not use Tex_DoEnvironment.

2003-09-12 03:25  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.xml:

	- documentation about the new Tex_Env_name settings to customize

2003-09-06 13:07  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	Bug: @/ would sometimes change from its previous value when using
	     IMAP_Jumpfunc().
	Why: s:RemoveLastHistoryItem sets @/ to the last search item in the @/
	     history, but @/ is not necessarily always the last item in the @/
	     history.
	Fix: Remember @/ in Tex_LastSearchPattern and then restore it.

	* makefile:

	removing explorer.vim and adding filebrowser.vim in the archives

2003-09-02 23:49  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.xml:

	- descriptions of the new g:Tex_UseMakefile and also g:Tex_UsePython and
	  g:Tex_Debug options.

2003-09-02 22:56  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: compiler.vim, texrc:

	- implement Alan Schmitt's idea of a Tex_UseMakefile option. Setting this
	  to zero means that latex-suite will completeley ignore the presence of a
	  makefile in the current directory.

2003-09-02 00:15  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	- merge from the file-browser branch. restructuring to get the correct
	  style and also to use filebrowser.vim instead of explorer.vim

2003-09-02 00:13  srinathava

	* plugin/filebrowser.vim:

	- new lightweight replacement for explorer.vim

2003-09-02 00:13  srinathava

	* plugin/explorer.vim:

	no longer need explorer.vim in latex-suite

2003-09-02 00:12  srinathava

	* plugin/explorer.vim:

	- no longer need explorer.vim in latex-suite.

2003-09-02 00:08  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.xml:

	- Some minore outstanding changes.

2003-09-02 00:07  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/multicompile.vim:

	- A little rearrangement to make some functions faster.

2003-09-02 00:05  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	- Do not use the :silent! in \ll etc even if has('gui') because
	  1. seeing all the "will rerun because .bbl file changed" etc is very
	     helpful.
	  2. More often that not, it prevents the user from being able to see bugs
	     which he can report.
	  I will go back to the original way if I receive comments otherwise.
	- remove the <F10> map because latex-suite doesn't use it anymore.

2003-09-01 18:56  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/multicompile.vim:

	- Improved behavior: If there is an error in any of the compilation steps,
	  return without rerunning anything else.

2003-08-31 02:20  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.xml:

	- resync the multiple compilation documentation with the current algorithm.

2003-08-31 02:04  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/multicompile.vim:

	Bug: If compiling latex causes an error and bibtex/makeindex is run
	     afterwards, the errors dissapear from the clist, causing us to think
	     there were no errors in the document.
	Fix: Always re-parse the .log file after all compilers have been called to
	     ensure that we will always be able to find problems with the latex
	     compilation.

2003-08-31 01:25  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/multicompile.vim:

	- Refactored code to only have one copy of the main function
	  Tex_CompileMultipleTimes() instead of maintaining a duplicate. Just
	  duplicate the helper functions.

	- Also removed a bug in the original version where a change in the index
	  terms was not causing latex to be rerun.

2003-08-28 20:44  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.xml:

	added description of <F9> for commands such as \bibliographystyle

	removed a required setting in the last commit.

2003-08-28 18:12  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	Modification and refactoring this file to

	2. make it use filebrowser.vim instead of the standard explorer.vim

2003-08-28 12:19  srinathava

	* plugin/filebrowser.vim:

	A lightwieght replacement for explorer.vim so we need not interefere with
	the vim distro.

2003-08-28 12:17  srinathava

	* plugin/filebrowser.vim:

	Botch up with the previous addition. It got added in the main branch. I am
	removing it from there and adding it into the branch as promised.

2003-08-28 12:16  srinathava

	* plugin/filebrowser.vim:

	A lightweight replacement for explorer.vim so we can remove that.

	NOTE: This is a commit on a branch. Do not use this for any production
	purposes.

2003-08-22 15:09  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.xml:

	- added the bit about how to over-ride macros set by latex-suite.
	- the latest version of db2vim also folds up subsections within sections.

2003-08-04 13:18  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	Removing variant of Tex_CompletePackageName. It doesn't work because of
	bug in Vim and this bug won't be fixed soon.

2003-07-26 17:46  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.xml:

	Bug in description of folding...

2003-07-26 12:52  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texmenuconf.vim:

	Bug-fix: Some menu items did not work

2003-07-26 12:15  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	Bug: When latex-suite is packaged as a system wide utility installed in
	     /usr/share/vim/vim61, then the local texrc file in
	     ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex/texrc does not get sourced as claimed in the
	     documentation. (Chris Greenwood)
	Why: latex-suite tries to source ../tex/texrc from where main.vim resides,
	     which in the case of system wide installations is not
	     ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex/texrc
	Fix: Just use :runtimepath instead of using s:up_path etc.

2003-07-26 12:10  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	- documentation bug fix about location of local texrc.

2003-07-24 18:22  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	make Tex_GetMainFileName return filename with ' ' escaped.

2003-07-24 18:21  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texproject.vim:

	escape filename while saving etc (Diego Carafini).

	Also only source mainfilename if its .latexmain. This change is in
	anticipation of future changes when Tex_GetMainFileName() will return
	expand('%:p') when a .latexmain does not exist. In this case, we do not
	want to source the .tex file...

2003-07-24 18:13  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Change: Escape ' ' in file names when passing the filename to an external
	        command (Diego Carafini).

2003-07-23 20:03  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	Change: Use "\n" instead of the inverted ! character to delimit strings in
	        g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings. (Pan Shizhu).
	        Also a slight improvement in the infile documentation about
	        installation.

2003-07-23 19:52  srinathava

	* compiler/tex.vim:

	Bug: Pan Shizhu writes:
	    You defined a character which looks like a reversed `!' as the
	    delimeter of global var g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings, but this character will
	    definetely cause problem on many systems (mainly non-latin systems such
	    as Chinese, Japanese and Korean).
	Fix: Replace the inverted '!' with "\n". This might cause some backwards
	     compatibility problems.

2003-07-19 00:12  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/mathmacros.vim:

	- utilize the g:Tex_MainMenuLocation in mathmacros.vim

2003-07-19 00:05  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/custommacros.vim:

	- the new macro menu did not work because we did not use <SID>

2003-07-19 00:03  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texmenuconf.vim:

	- In preperation for the next stable release, I am trimming away unwanted
	  and unused things. We should I think, no longer insist on the texrc
	  architechture like before, but advise any customization to directly into
	  the user's ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex.vim.

	- also removing the menus for project stuff because they are not used right
	  now.

2003-07-17 19:21  srinathava

	* makefile:

	- creating targets
	    release: for making temporary dated releases of the form
	        latexSuite20030618.zip etc.
	    updoc: for updating the documentation to the latest cvs.
	    uphtdocs: for updating the htdocs directory (the web-page) with the
	        latest cvs. Will also update the package and template list. Will
	        also update the ChangeLog which is linked from the download page.

	  I have tried to setup the webpage in such a way that the entire
	  maintainence can be done via make remotely. Please do it this way. For
	  example, when making changes to the web-page, make changes in a locally
	  checked out copy and do "make uphtdocs". If you make some changes to the
	  user manual, do "make updoc". If you wish to make a dated release to fix
	  a temporary bug-fix etc, do "make release".

2003-07-17 00:25  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.xml:

	including documentation about Tex_MainFileExpression.

2003-07-16 09:44  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	Bug: If g:Tex_SmartQuoteOpen/Close contain the '~' character (french quotes
	     are "~" and "~", then we get an error in quotations (Mathieu
	     Clabaut).
	Fix: escape ~ in the search() function (Mathieu Clabaut).

	Change: make Tex_GetMainFile() recursively search upwards for a *.latexmain
	        file.

2003-07-16 09:42  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Bug: Sometimes moving up and down in the error list window causes a regexp
	     error.
	Fix: properly escape backslashes in the regexp.

2003-07-15 22:27  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.xml:

	A couple of additions/grammatical corrections.

2003-07-15 22:17  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: texmenuconf.vim, texrc:

	Change: Peter Heslin (maintaining the cream port of latex-suite says that
	        the Windows menu from cream appears in the middle of the
	        latex-suite menus). A new variable g:Tex_MainMenuLocation is used
	        to find the location of the latex-suite menus.

2003-07-15 14:33  mikmach

2003-07-10 02:52  srinathava

	* ftplugin/: tex/texviewer.vim, latex-suite/main.vim:

	Trying to robustify the grep commands which are used to search for \labels
	etc using a new function Tex_EscapeForGrep. Use this henceforth whenever we
	:grep for something from within vim.

2003-07-09 15:36  mikmach

2003-07-06 11:50  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/latexm.vim:

	better handling of whether the vim has +python or not.

2003-07-05 23:59  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/latexm.vim:

	added a viml implementation of the multiple compile function.
	TODO: What is the technically _correct_ way to compile a latex file?
	      Is the method given in Luc Hermitte's tex-tools.vim correct?

2003-07-02 02:49  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/latexm.vim:

	- multiple calls to the latex compiler to get the cross-references right,
	  run bibtex as necessary etc.
	  NOTE: This commit is on a branch. I will confer with the group before
	  making any main trunk commits.

2003-06-29 18:33  srinathava

	* indent/tex.vim:

	do not change indentation of commented lines

2003-06-29 18:28  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	default g:Tex_RememberCiteSearch to zero. This means that the \cite list is
	renewed every time as documented in the manual.

2003-06-29 18:27  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	Corrected an obvious syntax error. I dont know what was being attempted
	here though. Mikolaj: Please document this file better! It would be really
	nice if you could send out an email to the vim-latex-devel list outlining
	the feature you are going to implement and how you plant to do it before
	actually doing it. This way we all have a say in whats going on... Also
	better documentation is a must! There is no mention anywhere what this
	"plugintype" thing is supposed to be.

2003-06-29 18:21  srinathava

	* doc/Makefile.in:

	include targets for quickstart guide. Also use the --prefix argument for
	the latest db2vim to avoid conflics between tags in various help files.

2003-06-29 18:18  srinathava

	* plugin/explorer.vim:

	First attempt at trying to make explorer.vim not conflict with the default
	explorer.vim which ships with vim. It would have been _really_ nice to have
	first discussed the implementation of this feature so I could have avoided
	this problem beforehand. :(

2003-06-29 01:31  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	Bug: Using completion in the following situation: \cite{something,<F9>
	     does not work properly because "something" is considered the prefix.
	Fix: change the s:prefix variable when we have a \cite command to support
	     multiple citations seperated by commas (SA)

2003-06-28 23:15  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	Bug: \bibitems were not being scanned properly.
	Why: Used grepadd \\bibitem{ instead of just grepadd \bibitem{
	Fix: Use 'grep \bibitem{'

2003-06-27 15:20  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	- changed ETR to insert a more complete template using Tex_SpecialMacros
	  (Mathieu CLABAUT)

2003-06-22 10:57  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	Bug: On windows gvim +cygwin, \cite completion does not work when the bib
	     file is in a completeley different location.
	Cause: gvim calls grep as "grep -nH @.*{ /path/to/file"
	       which does not work because grep thinks / corresponds to something
	       like c:/cygwin, so it looks for the file in the wrong place.
	Fix: Always lcd to the current directory of the bib file being searched.
	     This avoids any path issues.

2003-06-21 15:16  srinathava

	* doc/latex-suite.txt:

	Oops! Some debugging statements got into latex-suite.txt. Have modified
	db2vim so it doesn't happen again.

2003-06-21 15:13  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.xml:

	More documentation. more fixed typos...
	Still a lot more to go...

2003-06-19 23:11  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	Bug: A recent change made in order to recognize strings such as
	     \psfig{file=} for completion resulted in not completing
	     \ref{eqn: ! (Sorry)
	Fix: Change the regexp again.

	Change: Use redraw! for helping terminal users. and also do not use
	        <silent> unless we have gui running.

2003-06-19 23:02  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.xml:

	Bug: IMAP_Jumpfunc() and VEnclose() do not work with &selection =
	     'exclusive' (Jannie Hofmeyr, Pierre Antoine Champin)
	Fix: Select one more character in 'exclusive' mode. (suggested by Pierre
	     Antoine Champin).

2003-06-18 11:58  srinathava

	* doc/README:

	Instructions on how to build the various output formats from the XML
	source.

2003-06-18 11:54  srinathava

	* doc/: latex-suite-chunk.xsl, latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.xml,
	  latex-suite.xsl:

	Oops. snipped Tex_TEXINPUTS section from wrong place.

2003-06-18 10:28  srinathava

	* doc/latex-suite.xml:

	Remove duplicate section on g:Tex_TEXINPUTS.

2003-06-17 23:17  srinathava

	* makefile:

	Also include the remoteOpen and bib_latexSuite files for the release.

2003-06-17 22:12  srinathava

	* doc/: Makefile.in, latex-suite-chunk.xsl, latex-suite-common.xsl,
	  latex-suite.css, latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.xml,
	  latex-suite.xsl:

	New documentation files in the doc directory contain all the xml and xsl
	stuff needed to build the help files in various formats.

	From now on, only latex-suite.xml will be directly modified.

	latex-suite.txt, latex-suite.html and latex-suite/*.html will all be
	automatically generated from the master .xml file.

	The new method of making a release:

	1. From the vimfiles/ directory issue a :make command.
	2. From this directory issue a :make ls-txt command.
	3. From the vimfiles/ directory issue a :make upload command.

	These three steps will be gathered into a single :make release target for
	the future.

2003-06-17 18:09  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	Bug: Use Tex_GetMainFileName(':p:r') to find the complete path-name of the
	     master file, not Tex_GetMainFileName(':p').

	Change: Do not use the v:errmsg mechanism for finding out if an error
	        occured in opening a custom package. Sometimes, other errors could
	        occur _after_ the file is opened, causing v:errmsg to be corrupted.
	        Instead check to see using bufnr(), which should be more robust.

	Change: Use silent! while opening and closing folds, otherwise we get
	        errors on terminal.

2003-06-17 18:03  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	In the viewer rules for windows, do not use full paths. Ask the user to
	set the $PATH variable to include the directories containing the programs.
	This is more portable than before.

	Set default value for g:Tex_RememberCiteSearch, Tex_BIBINPUTS and
	Tex_TEXINPUTS

2003-06-17 17:57  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Bug: If we used :TTarget ps, then the compiler would be called as:
	        dvips -o file.tex.ps file.tex.dvi
	     instead of
	        dvips -o file.ps file.dvi
	Why: In a recent change, we made RunLaTeX() use filenames with extension.
	     However, some compilation rules might require filenames w/o extensions
	     (such as Tex_CompileRule_ps which is 'dvips -o $*.ps $*.dvi')
	Fix: Try to guess if the &makeprg requires files w/o extensions by seeing
	     if it matches '\$\*\.\w\+'. If so, use file-name w/o extension.
	     Otherwise, retain extension in 'make '.fname

2003-06-17 10:26  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	More bug fixes!
	Bug: Pressing <F9> at the end of a line like
	     This is a \ref{eqn:something} and this is a comp
	     would cause errors.
	Why: The substitute() command returns the original string if the pattern
	     does not match causing us to wrongly infer a match.
	Fix: Therefore first check if there is a match.

	Bug: Once we complete an equation, we can never complete a word.
	Why: s:type is never unlet
	Fix: unlet! s:type if there is no match on current line to any known
	     command.

	Bug: Pressing <CR> during word completion does not take us to the location
	     of the match, as claimed.
	Why: <CR> does "cc <num> | pclose! | cclose!". Because the preview window
	     with the match is open, therefore cc will take us to the match in
	     the preview window, after which pclose closes it up!
	Fix: Do 'pclose! cc <num> | cclose' instead...

2003-06-17 09:22  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	New: Also support '\psfig{figure=' for completion.

2003-06-17 02:35  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	New: Bibliography searching was pretty delicate before where only a few
	     select situations succeeded in producing a match. Make this much more
	     robust using :find. This has the advantage of letting us use vim's
	     native file-searching capability to find out bibliography file etc.
	New: Capability to retain the \cite search in memory so we do not have to
	     make searches with every <F9> pressed. This is useful because quite
	     often the bibliography is a _huge_ file which is not changed very
	     seldom and we might want add a lot of \cite's between changes to the
	     bibliography file.

2003-06-16 19:12  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	A small change to include every debug statement in the default string.

2003-06-16 19:07  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	Change: Instead of using very complicated logic to find out the locations
	        of package files, just use vim's native :find command. This easily
	        avoids problems of not being able to search more than 1 level deep
	        etc. Ofcourse, this means that the users have to specify
	        g:Tex_TEXINPUTS in the format given in :help file-searching, but
	        that seems a very acceptable thing to do.
	        Why was globpath() and all that used previously?

2003-06-16 19:00  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	Bug: <F5> does not work if we type in the name of a package latex-suite
	     doesn't recognize. a 0 is inserted.
	Cause: In the recent feature where Tex_PutEnvironment also tried to scan
	       environments added by packages, there is no fail-safe at the end of
	       all the if statements.
	Solution: if all else fails remember to at least insert a bare-bones
	          environment.

2003-06-15 23:40  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	Bug: When a \usepackage{} line is inside a fold, then we go into an
	     infinite loop. (Lin-bo Zhang)
	Cause: Due to an apparent vim bug, when if we issue the command
	       /somepattern
	       in a closed fold, then we always goto the first match in the fold.
	Solution: A temporary hack of first opening up all folds before scanning
	          and then closing them. This needs to be robustified in the future
	          using mkview.vim

2003-06-15 01:44  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Change: ViewLaTeX() no longer uses a:size input argument. instead using the
	        b:fragmentFile buffer variable.

2003-06-15 01:43  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	issue a debug call when catching the latexSuite autocommand.

2003-06-15 01:42  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	Use the more standard TexLet way to set default options instead of exists()
	and stuff.

2003-06-15 01:23  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/bibtex.vim:

	Changed structure of bibtex.vim to look more ``modular''. Still don't know
	if this is a good idea. Might revert to older revision in the future.

	Feature: added way to customize the fields which are applied via the
	         mappings.

2003-06-15 01:09  srinathava

	* ftplugin/bib_latexSuite.vim:

	create a bib_latexSuite.vim file to be able to also support bib files. This
	file basically sources bibtex.vim, which contains maps to insert
	bibliographic entries easily.

2003-06-14 22:23  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	Bug: Sometimes Tex_FindBblFiles() would return a bunch of files with
	     new-lines in them.
	Cause: substitue(text, '\n', ' ', 'ge')
	       doesn't remove newlines (at least in vanilla vim 6.1).
	Solution: Use substitute(text, "\n", ' ', 'ge')
	          instead. NOTE: use double quotes when using special characters in
	          replacement string in substitute().

	Bug: Sometimes the latex file would get the maps from Tex_c_window_setup().
	Cause: The maps would be created even when s:UpdateViewerWindow() closed
	       off the quickfix and preview window because of error E32 and focus
	       returned to the latex window.
	Solution: Check if &ft == 'qf' before setting maps.

	Bug: If the tex file used a '\bibliography' command to include a .bib file,
	     it would not be found. (on windows)
	Cause: Used ':' as a path seperator. which crashes on windows, because a
	       path is of the form c:/path/to/something (i.e ':' is a character in
	       every path!!)
	Solution: Use "\n" as a path seperator on windows.
	          TODO: Should we be using "\n" for other OSs too?

2003-06-13 21:43  srinathava

	* plugin/remoteOpen.vim:

	Change: Previously, if a file was not opened in any other session, then it
	        would open it in a new session. But for projects with lots of
	        files, this can become painful. Therefore, instead of opening in
	        new sessions each time, open files in the same session we used the
	        first time we had to create a session.

2003-06-13 14:41  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	Bug: When a \usepackage line is found, then a spurious { is inserted into
	     the search history. (A. S. Budden, Mpiktas)
	Cause: a "normal! /{\<CR>" command is executed.
	Solution: call histdel at the end of the function.

2003-06-12 01:16  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	Bug: 'scrolloff' remains at 100 even after we complete the reference (Jakub
	     Turski)
	Cause: 'scrolloff' is a global setting, not local
	Solution: Preserve the value of &scrolloff and reset it just before
	          quitting any of the windows.

2003-06-08 20:34  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	Bug: More stupid windows issues. Sometimes,
	    getcwd() = 'c:\path\to\file' and expand('%:p:h') = 'c:/path/to/file'
	    which causes s:searchdirectory to become '' causing Tex_completion to
	    search as
	        fgrep \label /*.tex
	Solution:
	    s:searchdirectory = expand('%:p:h') instead of expand('%:h')

2003-06-08 16:42  srinathava

	* plugin/remoteOpen.vim:

	This script provides a command :RemoteOpen which is supposed to be used
	from the command line as follows:

	gvim -c ":RemoteOpen +<lnum> <filename>"

	where <lnum> is the line-number you wish <filename> to open to.  What will
	happen is that a new gvim will start up and enquire from all previous
	sessions if <filename> is already open in any of them. If it is, then it
	will edit the file in that session and bring it to the foreground and itself
	quit. Otherwise, it will not quit and instead open up the file for editing
	at <lnum>.

	This was mainly created to be used with Yap (the dvi previewer in miktex),
	so you can specify the program for "inverse search" as specified above.
	This ensures that the inverse search uses the correct gvim each time.

2003-06-08 15:30  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	Bug: <F9> only worked the first time.

2003-06-08 15:14  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: compiler.vim, wizardfuncs.vim:

	Bug: compiling parts of a document did not open up the preview of the .log
	     file.
	Cause: mainfname was not defined in part compilation

	A lot of restructuring in compiler.vim and wizardfuncs.vim. See the
	accompanying e-mail to vim-latex-devel. Will also note this in Changelog.

2003-06-08 13:25  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	Bug: syntax error made the maps in envmacros.vim get triggered only for the
	     first buffer which latex-suite triggered on.

2003-06-07 14:02  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	Bug: <F9> did not work with the following
	        \includegraphics[0.8\columnwidth]{}
	     because the regexp thought that s:type = '\columnwidth]'
	     Improved the regexp to account for commands within options. Still not
	     tested extensively, but should be better than before.

	Bug: "wincmd q" does not always seem to work from within the script (this
	    is a vim bug). replace with q which seems more reliable.

2003-06-07 03:39  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/texviewer.vim:

	Bug: <F9> for inserting references does not work in standard vim + cygwin
	     combination for windows.
	Cause: Vim issues commands via the vimrun.exe program which calls the
	    cygwin bash shell in the following manner:
	        bash -c "command"
	    when we do ":!command" from within vim. With the current setup we issue
	    the command
	        !fgrep "\\label{" *.tex > c:/TEMP/VIe12.tmp
	    This gets converted into
	        bash -c "fgrep "\\label{" *.tex > c:/TEMP/VIe12.tmp"
	    by vimrun.exe. This causes all sorts of confusion.
	Solution: Avoid issuing commands which contain double quotes otherwise
	    vimrun.exe screws up. Convert the grep commands to
	        grep '\label{' *.tex
	    from
	        grep "\\label{" *.tex
	    NOTE: the backslash escaping still needs to be done due to the outer
	    double quotes in the exec statement.

2003-06-06 15:53  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	omitted g: before one test for g:Tex_UseMenuWizard in inserting of environments

2003-06-03 02:45  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Bug:
	Srinath: but your patch makes impossible to distinguish between various
		extenstions of LaTeX files - .tex, .ltx and so on

	Solution: use not :r files for compiling but remove extension when
		dealing with quickfix window

	But with both versions I have serious bug: when walking with j, k and
	<cr> through list of errors I am getting message:

	PositionPreviewWindow:
	Line 62:
	E486: Pattern not found: ((f|[|])*myfile.tex

2003-06-02 22:58  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Bug: the preview window with the .log window was not being opened on
	     compilation error.
	Cause: We used to depend on the file's suffix being removed for a lot of
	       processing. A recent change seems to have reversed this.

2003-06-02 06:39  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	Remove hardcoded .tex extension in CompilerRule_pdf - after removing :r in RunLatex it was doubling extension to myfile.tex.tex. NOTE: update of personal texrc is required! (Animesh N Nerurkar)

2003-05-29 21:30  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: texmenuconf.vim, wizardfuncs.vim:

	Bug: undefined mapleader variable causes crashes.

	New file: ChangeLog

	Why? As I wrote previously latexSuite will be packaged for Debian.
	Packager asked me if something like this exists because it would be
	great help for him. But I think it will help regular users - they should
	know why it is worth to download new version. Maybe link from site?
	Please add ChangeLog entries parallel to CVS commit comments

	Format (new entries should go to top of the file):

	Dealing with TEXINPUTS and packages.
	Unfortunately relations of Vim with shell are not
	straightforwart. We cannot assume that always we
	will know its value. Much simplier (although not
	so elegant) is g:Tex_TEXINPUTS variable.
	This should be equal to real $TEXINPUTS. More info

	Relative path under Windows was given with wrong file delimiter

2003-04-04 15:27  mikmach

	* plugin/explorer.vim:


	This is almost standard version of explorer plugin. This addition to lS
	is necessary for things like explorer-completion.

	Change is to make EditEntry function global available. It makes possible
	to remap standard explorer shortcuts for better interaction with lS.
	I signalized this on vim@vim.org and hope it will be standard behaviour
	of explorer.vim in next Vim editions thus we won't need this file. But
	for today pros are much more than contras I think.

	(sorry for my english today, please correct my faults in latex-suite.txt
	if you find few minutes)

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	Bug: If an abbreviatin contains \ or " characters, then the abbreviation is
	     not expanded properly. (D. MacAlpine)
	Fix: Those characters need to be escaped before the quoting.

2003-03-25 00:20  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	Bug: Incorrect detection of abbreviations. If there was (were)
	     abbreviations starting with the letter 'a', then typing 'a<space>'
	     would trigger an expansion.
	Cause: The :iab command also echoes for partial completions.
	Solution: Check more thoroughly whether a word is an abbreviation LHS or
	          not.

2003-03-17 04:46  mikmach

2003-03-04 14:58  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Bug: When there are 2 vertically split windows, compiling causes window
	     layout to get messed up. (Alan Schmitt)
	Cause: UpdatePreviewWindow() was taking focus from the preview window to
	       the window _above_ it, not the window previously visited. This was
	       sometimes causing focus to go to one of the edited tex files.
	Fix: Goto previous window, not window above.

2003-03-03 12:57  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/folding.vim:

	Bug: Fold for slide ends with beginning of next slide. (Shawn L Young).
	Cause/Fix: syntax fold description for slide used '\end{slide' to terminate fold
	           beginning with '\begin{slide'

2003-02-28 12:21  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	New command to extract package name from within {}.
		exec "normal! /{\<CR>\"ayi}"

	Old version was cutting last char under Windows.

2003-02-05 15:29  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	Bug: iabs break when latex-suite is triggered.
	     (Preben Randhol, Sanip P Deshmukh)
	Cause: If a mapping ends in a letter (say '\'), then abbreviations are not
	    triggered by that letter. For example, if we have
	        imap \ <C-r>='\'<CR>
	        iab 12 twelve
	    Then typing 12\ doesn't expand to twelve\.
	    (Strangely enough "imap \ ?" doesn't have this problem and we get
	    twelve?. Vim bug?)
	    This problem is aggravated by the fact that latex-suite "protects"
	    most letters to avoid expansions such as ``2 -> `\sqrt{}
	Solution: After checking for mappings ending in a letter, if that letter is
	    not in 'iskeyword', then also check whether the previous word has
	    an abbreviation. Since vim does not have the equivalent of
	    mapcheck() for abbreviations, this is complicated (maybe even hacky).

2003-02-04 20:12  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	- Bug: imaps do not work on default win32 installations of vim because
	        :behave mswin
	       is set, which in turn sets &selection=inclusive. This makes
	       IMAP_Jumpfunc() skip selecting the last character of
	       Imap_PlaceHolderEnd. (Sumit Bhardwaj)
	  Solution: Temporarily set &selection = exclusive in IMAP_Jumpfunc().

2003-01-28 19:17  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/templates/IEEEtran.tex:

	Sumit Bhardwaj <b.sumit@ieee.org> contributed an template file to be used
	for IEEE transactions.

2003-01-21 14:23  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages/graphicx:

	- change syntax for the \includegraphics command. (Diego Caraffini)

2003-01-21 14:15  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/templates.vim:

	- use the updated syntax of Tex_pack_updateall

2003-01-21 14:15  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	- make Tex_pack_check() also update g:Tex_package_detected.
	- Make Tex_pack_updateall() use another argument force. A recent commit
	  added some intelligence to Tex_pack_updateall which made it do nothing if
	  it had scanned this file the last time... Sometimes we might want to
	  force it to rescan the same file again.

2003-01-21 14:10  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	- If g:Tex_package_detected contains 'graphicx' then use \includegraphics
	  instead of \psfig in the EFI mapping.

2003-01-20 11:59  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	- a tentative attempt to make including the graphicx package change the
	  behavior of EFI from \psfig to \includegraphics. Note that this is far
	  from ideal. For example, as of now, once the user opens a file with
	  \usepackage{graphicx}, then EFI will begin using \includegraphics even if
	  he switches back to a file without \usepackage{graphicx}.

	  Doing that will require extensive changes to the envmacros.vim file, I
	  think... (I haven't thought about it enough to find out if a simpler
	  workaround is possible).

2003-01-18 10:36  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages/babel:

	added regular latex commands to babel package file

2003-01-17 10:43  srinathava

	* makefile:

	- make things silent... Otherwise cvs errors, shell errors etc scroll off
	  the screen making things difficult to see.

2003-01-17 10:41  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	- Bug: When makefile is found,then latex-suite shifts focus to the quicfix
	       window. (Ulrich Spoerlein)
	  Fix: mainfname was not being initialized when makefile is found.

	  TODO: Should we change 'silent!' to 'silent'? RunLaTeX() was actually
	        throwing vim errors which were supressed.

2003-01-17 02:05  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages/babel:

	- A first go at the babel file. This file is sourced exactly once when it
	  is first detected by Tex_pack_updateall(). It then sets up an au to catch
	  the LatexSuiteScannedPackages event which gets thrown by
	  Tex_pack_updateall(). This enables it to set buffer local smart quote
	  characters each time \usepackage{babel} is seen.

2003-01-17 01:49  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	Oops! Syntax error. Talking about commiting "tested" code!

2003-01-17 01:24  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	- catch the LatexSuiteFileType event to update the package menu whenever we
	  switch buffers. This will enable us to reliably use package files which
	  set buffer variables.

2003-01-17 01:20  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: compiler.vim, folding.vim:

	- catch the LatexSuiteFileType event to set up buffer local maps.

2003-01-17 01:18  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	- catch the LatexSuiteFileType event thrown by tex_latexSuite.vim to set up
	  buffer local maps for each tex file.

2003-01-17 01:13  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	- main.vim used to help various other components set up mappings etc. This
	  was becoming ugly because it caused some unecessary dependencies... The
	  new tex_latexSuite.vim file enables us to remove these dependencies.
	  SetTeXOptions() now just sets options local to main.vim. Each of the
	  other components do their own stuff.

	  SetTeXOptions() is called by catching the LatexSuiteFileType event thrown
	  by tex_latexSuite.vim.

2003-01-17 01:09  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex_latexSuite.vim:

	- In the initial way of calling latex-suite, main.vim and correspondingly
	  every file through it would be source'd only once for every buffer. This
	  means that if a file needs to be called every time a filetype event
	  occurs (not just the first time), it wasn't possible. This limitation was
	  making adding a feature such as updating the packages menu when we switch
	  buffers very ugly to implement.

	  Adopt a much more elegant apprach. Throw a LatexSuiteFileType event every
	  time tex_latexSuite is sourced... This enables each component of
	  latex-suite to function independently without having to depend of
	  main.vim in the heavy manner they did previously. Components which need
	  to be sourced only once will ignore this event. Components which need to
	  set buffer local maps will catch this event and set the maps with some
	  reinclusion avoiding logic... and so on and so forth...
	  See the next few commits of main.vim, compiler.vim etc for details.

2003-01-16 22:37  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/custommacros.vim:

	- Use Tex_ChooseFromPrompt instead of Tex_ChooseFile

2003-01-16 22:37  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/templates.vim:

	- Use Tex_ChooseFromPrompt instead of Tex_ChooseFile
	- Use Tex_pack_updateall instead of Tex_pack_all

2003-01-16 22:36  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	- Transfer intelligence from Tex_pack_all to Tex_pack_updateall. Because we
	  want to scan every file, therefore do some optimization to speed things
	  up. Basically, try not to repeat "supporting" packages.

	- Also throw a LatexSuiteScannedPackages event at the end of
	  Tex_pack_updateall... This will be caught by the babel package.

2003-01-16 21:26  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	- Use Tex_ChooseFromPrompt instead of Tex_ChooseFile
	- Also create global variables of the form
	    g:Tex_{packname}_options
	  which contains options corresponding to \usepackage{packname}.

2003-01-16 09:49  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	- Previously if a file which didn't have \usepackage{german} triggered
	  latex-suite and then the user opened a file which did have
	  \usepackage{german}, then b:Tex_SmartQuote* would not change. We want to
	  process the \usepackage lines for every file... A first pass at
	  implementing this.
	  Make Tex_pack_updateall() get called every time SetTeXOptions() is called
	  by catching the LatexSuiteInit event thrown by SetTeXOptions().
	  TODO: This makes things slow, because Tex_pack_updateall is kind of dumb
	        updating the menu list... Often times, multiple files in the same
	        vim session use the same main file. In this case, it doesn't make
	        sense to "uncheck" all the menus and recreate them again. I'll
	        optimize it later to use such information...

2003-01-16 09:42  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	- Previously if a file which didn't have \usepackage{german} triggered
	  latex-suite and then the user opened a file which did have
	  \usepackage{german}, then b:Tex_SmartQuote* would not change. We want to
	  process the \usepackage lines for every file... A first pass at
	  implementing this.
	  As a long term solution, make SetTeXOptions() trigger a user autocommand
	  called LatexSuiteInit. This is caught by everyone who so wishes. This
	  enables us to not have to modify main.vim everytime...

2003-01-16 03:09  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages/ngerman:

	localized to buffer SmartQuotes

2003-01-15 18:49  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	- made greek letter expansions also use g:Tex_Leader. This provides another
	  way in which users can avoid unexpected expansions... (I dont know why
	  this was not the case till now...)
	  TODO: make greek letters optional.

	- Bug fix: Tex_CreatePrompt was not using a:sep throughout, causing it to
	  be broken for lists which were not , seperated.

	- New function Tex_ChooseFromPrompt. This function will in the future
	  replace the Tex_ChooseFile function...

2003-01-15 15:14  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages/ngerman:

	new package file

2003-01-15 08:24  macvimx

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages/german:

	     Make the Tex_SmartQuote* variables buffer-local, and change the
	close-quote string from '" to "' .

2003-01-15 08:23  macvimx

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	     I updated the comments above the Tex_SmartQuoteOpen and
	Tex_SmartQuoteClose variables.

2003-01-15 08:16  macvimx

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	Several changes to the s:TexQuotes() function:

	* more comments
	* fix a bug, introduced in the previous patch, when inserting " in math mode
	or after \ .
	* Do not assume that the open- and close-quote strings can be distinguished by
	their first characters.  (German uses "` and "'.)
	* Look for buffer-local versions of Tex_SmartQuoteOpen and Tex_SmartQuoteClose
	before using the global versions.

2003-01-14 18:54  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	- new function Tex_CreatePrompt.
	  " Description:
	  " Arguments:
	  "     promptList: This is a string of the form:
	  "         'item1,item2,item3,item4'
	  "     cols: the number of columns in the resultant prompt
	  "     sep: the list seperator token
	  "
	  " Example:
	  " Tex_CreatePrompt('item1,item2,item3,item4', 2, ',')
	  " returns
	  " "(1) item1\t(2)item2\n(3)item3\t(4)item4"
	  "
	  " This string can be used in the input() function.

2003-01-14 18:53  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	- moved g:Tex_PromptedEnvironmentsDefault and g:Tex_PromptedCommandsDefault
	  from envmacros.vim to here.

2003-01-14 18:52  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	- instead of custom functions for creating prompt strings of
	  environments/commands/templates/packages etc, use a function
	  Tex_CreatePrompt() everywhere. See main.vim for usage details.
	  It turns out the bug Mikolaj reported with the prompt not changing was
	  becuause of a buggy SetUpCommandPrompt() function.
	  TODO: There are many globally visible functions not starting with the
	        Tex_ prefix. Will have to fix that soon.

	- Code cleanup: bugs where introduced in previous versions when
	  Tex_ChangeEnvironments() was called with an argument. Will have to ask
	  Mikolaj to be a bit more careful in adding new features...

	- More cleanup: Also changed some script local variables to function local
	  variables...  Should ask Mikolaj not to use script local variables
	  unecessarily.  They make the code very unreadable. I always keep
	  wondering why this variable needs to be visible outside this function...

	- Code cleanup: g:Tex_PromptedEnvironmentsDefault and
	  g:Tex_PromptedCommandsDefault moved from here to packages.vim, which is a
	  more natural place for them.

2003-01-14 15:56  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	- fixed bug ^[0-9][0-9]$ in ....
	- Removed "loose ends" for handling $...$ and \(...\) commands

2003-01-14 15:00  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages/german:

	- defining the german quotes here... This makes any file in which
	  \usepackage{german} is detected use "` and '" as the quote characters...

2003-01-14 14:51  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	- Problem with last commit.

2003-01-14 14:46  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	- expansion of `g to \gamma makes writing german quotes difficult because
	  correct german quotes are "` and '". Protect this expansion as well...
	  TODO: This seems to getting wierd. A better way would have been to check
	  for math mode. But how to do that? Checking for synIDattr() =~? 'math' is
	  not good enough because \cite and \sum are both 'texStatement's.
	  TODO: Is this getting too annoying to be left enabled by default? Benji
	        suggests disabling this by default.

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	- previously created g:Tex_package_detected had a form:
	  inputencgeometrypolski
	  Not declared: inputenc,geometry,polski. Fixed.
	- Last command in package file (without , at the end) was losing last
	  letter. Fixed by adding , to commandList
	- Don't create separator if command and option lists in package file are
	  empty. Rare but possible.

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	- Added section in SetTeXOptions about TexPromptedCommands

2003-01-14 05:40  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	- Implementation of Fast Environment set of macros for LaTeX commands
	- Basically these are the same functions but rewritten to work for
	  commands - there are some oddities thus I decided to separate it
	  functionality from env macro - it is easier to read code. Maybe
	  integrate it later.
	- New mapping <F7> and <S-F7> to insert and change command name from
	  menu. It works properly only for \com{} style commands (not for $ and
	  \( )
	- There is one strange thing about updating
	  g:Tex_PromptedCommands/Environments (more about updating in log for
	  packages.vim).

	  When I run UpdateAll string g:Tex_PromptedCommands is corrected, but
	  it looks like SetUpCommandPrompt still use old value of variable.

	- Now you can use two-digit values in SetUpPrompt menus '^[0-9][0-9]$'

2003-01-14 05:40  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	- Added to Tex_pack_all() scanning for \newenvironment and \newcommand
	  lines and adds new names to g:Tex_Prompted variables.
	- Updating is based on g:Tex_...Default, whole scanning is done from
	  nil, thus it should work for removing \new..., but it doesn't work :(
	  It looks like SetUp...Prompt uses some cached values.

	* doc/newlatex-suite.txt:

	- temporary commit.

2003-01-11 00:42  srinathava

	* doc/newlatex-suite.txt:

	- New file: newlatex-suite.txt
	  This is a temporary file for reworking the documentation. I noticed that
	  the original documentation read too much like a story... In particular,
	  the table of contents was too wordy and the user didn't get a nice
	  overview at a glance. This is an attempt to rework mainly the TOC and
	  maybe some of the sections too...
	  In particular:
	  - add sections for how to customize. A section containing all the
	    available options.
	  - a section containing all available <Plug>'d maps and again how to
	    override the default maps.
	  - add documentation for bibtex.vim, which provides nice support for
	    editing .bbl files. (Alan G Isaac promised some docs for this long ago,
	    but hasn't yet given any).

	Once we get this file incorporated into the main latex-suite.txt, I will
	push this into the attic. I could have started a new branch for this, but
	it felt like too much work...

2003-01-11 00:25  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	- Protect all printable ascii characters in the range 32-127 from
	  accidental expansion at the beginning of a tex double quote. (Felt a need
	  for this when I realized that ``* and such were still trouble causers).
	  Is this way too agressive?

2003-01-09 21:33  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	- removing a few lines which do not seem to be used anywhere.
	- corrected the placeholder description for the \list command.
	- adding 'description' to the Lists menu (macro in insert mode is EDE)
	- changing paragraph macro from SPR to SPG as documented.

2003-01-09 21:11  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	- Charles Boncelet suggested `M -> \sum_{}^{}.
	- In order to guard against expanding to \sum.. on typing M at the start of
	  a quotation, create a fake map
	    call IMAP('``M', '``M', 'tex')
	  Since IMAP() always uses the longest lhs ending in a character, this fake
	  map elegantly solves the problem. Use this strategy to "protect" greek
	  letter mappings as well. So now we do not need a special
	  s:TEX_InsertGreekLetter() function... Just create fake maps like
	  ``a -> ``a and \`a -> \`a.

2003-01-07 11:43  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	- Description of arguments to IMAP_Jumpfunc().
	- IMAP_Jumpfunc() is now able to handle <+placeholders
	  withlinebreaks+>
	- Bug: If we were selecting in the backward direction, and we want to move
	       backwards, then 2 <Plug>IMAP_JumpBack's are needed. i.e, if we have
		   <+1+> <+2+> <+3+>
		   and we do (with <C-k> mapped to <Plug>IMAP_JumpBack)
		   <C-j><C-j><C-k>, from before <+1+>, then we remain in <+2+>.
		   (Bug pointed out by LH)
	  Cause: In visual mode, <Plug>IMAP_JumpBack deselects the text but remains
	         at the end of the selection. (this is default vim behavior).
			 Therefore searching back for the placeholder start character lands
			 us up in the template.
	  Solution: In visual mode, make <Plug>IMAP_JumpBack goto `< after
	            deselecting text. This strategy also leads to considerable
				simplification at other places.

2003-01-07 10:27  macvimx

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	* Improve s:PutTextWithMovement() by using a new helper function, IMAP_Mark(),
	to position the cursor instead of adding a marker string and searching for it.
	The marker would cause serious trouble if it occurred anywhere in the inserted
	text, and minor trouble if it was too long and caused an unwanted line break.

	* Fix a bug (mea culpa) in s:LookupCharacter() and IMAP_list().  If there was
	a global map for "foo" and a local (filetype) map for "bozo" then these
	functions would look at the last character, "o", see that there were local
	maps ending in "o", and only look for local maps.

2003-01-06 17:51  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/smartspace.vim:

	Change from Carl:

	    One little improvement in TexFormatLine.  First, my treatment of \$
	    isn't working, so I deleted it.  But I was able to take care of the
	    following.  Sometimes people write $$...$$ in a single line, so the
	    function should be able to tell that you are within a math expression.

	    Also, I didn't think that your command for clearing memory deserved its
	    own variable, so I just put an extra line in the function.

	    For the moment, I don't know what to do about \$

2003-01-06 02:10  srinathava

	* makefile:

	- removing the betaup target.
	- adding a release: target and uphtdocs: target.
	  As of now, both of these have hardcoded srinathava@vim-latex. If someone
	  wants this to change, let me know.
	  The release: target is meant to take care of the annoying problem where
	  every once in a while, releases made via my computer generate CRLF style
	  files. Doing a release via SF should eliminate this problem.
	- uphtdocs is a way of synchronizing the latex-suite webpage with the
	  latest CVS snapshot.

2003-01-05 16:17  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/smartspace.vim:

	- removing the time stamp string. It is causing problems in merging from
	  branches etc.
	- Bug: Pressing a <space> before the second $ of a line like:
	       $aaaaa........$
		   caused spurious newlines to be inserted after the current line.
	  Cause: Carl knows.
	  Solution: [Cut/paste from Carl Mueller's email about this]

		  I do have an answer for the problem of typing the space before the
		  "$" in $aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...$.  But it does involve making
		  TexFormatLine dependent on 2 new variables, current_line and
		  current_column, which record the line (as a string) and the column
		  number.  With that change, it's easy to modify the "if" statement at
		  the end of the function.  I also have to modify the function TexFill,
		  to define and pass on the new variables.

2003-01-05 00:46  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	Bug: More debugging the debug functions! Ahh... The irony. The
	     Tex_PrintDebug() function wasn't working well.
	Cause/Solution: used a:pattern instead of pattern

	Bug: Refer to 1.17 of envmacros.vim
	Solution: Used the Tex_SetFastEnvironmentMaps() from envmacros.vim in order
	          to set buffer local mappings for the <F5> and <S-F5> keys for
	          every tex file opened.

2003-01-05 00:36  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	Bug: <F5> was mapped for all buffers, not just tex files. <S-F5> on the
	     other hand was mapped only for the buffer which activates latex-suite.
	Cause: -- ditto --
	Solution: Provide <plug>ed mappings in here and a function
	          Tex_SetFastEnvironmentMaps(). This function is called from
	          main.vim for every buffer. Thus buffer local maps are made for
	          every tex file opened.

2003-01-04 20:50  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/smartspace.vim:

	Bug fix from Carl Mueller.
	Bug: Reformatting is not done when <space> is pressed at the end of a line like:
	     $aaaaaa.......$ asdf
	    where there are say > &tw 'a's. In other words, reformatting isn't done
	    outside the '$'s.
	Cause: Do not really know, should ask Carl
	Solution: Apparently the diff here...

	TODO: Still one more bug. Pressing <space> in the position
	      $aaaaaaaa.........................aaa $ asdf
	                                           ^
	      shown makes new lines appear after this line.

2003-01-04 20:39  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	. There are still some serious bugs in the smartspace mapping. Also, in
	  accordance with the the philosophy of "no surprises even if you haven't
	  read the surprises", I am reluctant to do something as agressive as
	  setting 'tw' to zero by default. People who want this should read the
	  docs, understand the implications and then activate this option.

2003-01-04 18:19  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	Another great bug report from Ulrich Spoerlein.
	Bug: When the following .tex file is opened with latex-suite, we get a
	     choose package prompt:
	-----------------------------%<-----------------------------
	\documentclass{report}
	\usepackage[a4paper, pdftex, dvips, ps2pdf,
			bookmarks, bookmarksopen, bookmarksnumbered,
			colorlinks, linkcolor=blue, urlcolor=blue]{hyperref}
	\usepackage{cite}
	\begin{document}
	\end{document}
	-----------------------------%<-----------------------------
	Cause: the original algorithm for finding packages failed when the
	       \usepackage definition was split across lines as shown here.
	Solution: Rewrite the Tex_pack_all function to act much more robustly.
	          This method is able to account for multiple line definitions
	          pretty well.
	          Just to be on the safe side, ensure that Tex_pack_one is never
	          called with '' which causes the prompt.

2003-01-03 16:56  srinathava

	* doc/latex-suite.txt:

	Remove a bit of pedantic stuff from the docs. We seem to be explaining the
	same thing too many times...

2003-01-03 16:49  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	Made the debugging statements more advanced. Each file can now call
	Tex_Debug as
	    call Tex_Debug('something', 'modulename')
	Afterwards, we can do:
	    call Tex_PrintDebug('modulename')
	This way debugging statements from various modules will not interfere with
	each other.

	These functions might seem like bloat, but the reason I am making them is
	that in the future when latex-suite becomes even bigger, it might be
	painful to find out why a user is facing problems. In such cases, we might
	want to tell the user to do something like, "Set g:Tex_Debug = 1, do `lv
	and then please tell us what g:Tex_PrintDebug('compiler') says" (if for
	instance the user has some compilation/viewing problems).

2003-01-03 16:44  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	Since IMAP() is used so often, we do not want the Debug statements to cause
	a memory leak. Otherwise the debug string will get generally very huge on
	long usage of latex-suite/imaps.

2003-01-03 15:08  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/smartspace.vim:

	Bug: Ulrich Spoerlein reports that, when we press <space> after the
	     following line:
	          $aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.........$
	     ^
	     line starts here. There is a space before the leading $
	     Then smartspace makes vim go into an infinite loop.
	Fix: Instead of trying to see if the first character of the line is '$',
	     check if the first non blank character is a '$'. This seems a little
	     like a temporary fix though..

2003-01-03 00:42  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	Bug: call IMAP('""', '"<++>"<++>', '<+', '+>') doesnt work.
	     In general, any mapping ending in double quote doesn't work.
	Cause: Double quotes need to be escaped in the call to LookupCharacter().

2003-01-03 00:22  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	Unfortunately, have to repeat Tex_Debug* functions here in case this plugin
	is used without latex-suite... Script bloat! Maybe when all of the imaps
	bugs are removed (!) we can remove these functions...

2002-12-31 11:20  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	. Remove mappings for jumping back. The user can still choose to use this
	  functionality by uncommenting lines in the texrc (that modification coming
	  soon).

2002-12-31 11:15  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/brackets.vim:

	. Follow the <Plug>ed mappings philosophy here as well...
	. TODO: The meta mappings for brackets.vim might be removed by default in
	  future revisions because they do really annoying things for european
	  users. Only the <plugs> will be provided. A new section in texrc will
	  contain the maps which the user can customize...

2002-12-31 02:04  srinathava

	* doc/imaps.txt:

	Starting the doc file for the imaps.vim plugin. This is just a quick hack
	job for now. Its not in the releaseable state yet. But I will keep working
	at it in the next few days when I get the time... This doc file should
	describe the various imaps options for placeholders and also how to
	override the mappings for jumping back and forth...

2002-12-31 01:36  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/brackets.vim:

	Bug: <M-c> inserts '\label{<++>}<++>' literally without using
	     IMAP_PutTextWithMovement('\label{<++>}<++>').

2002-12-31 01:21  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	1. Problem: When the user tries to trigger an abbreviation near the eol,
	   the marker string being too long triggers a line break.
	   Therefore, just for the time being check to see if phs != phe, and if
	   so, then use phs.phs as the marker (improbable string).
	   We would like ultimately to completeley get over this hack and use
	   movement instead.

	2. Problem: The <C-K> map for jumping back was interfering with the
	   dictionary completion mode of vim. Therefore change default mapping for
	   jumping back to <S-C-J> instead of <C-K>. Ofcourse this makes it
	   invisible to non-gui users (I think).

	3. Tried to do the "right" thing for mapping. First provide a number of
	   mappings using <plug>. These mappings call IMAP_Jumpfunc() in various
	   ways. Various <plug> mappings for various modes have been provided.
	   After this, we map the default keys to the <plug> mappings checking for
	   hasmapto() each time. This provides for a robust and easy user
	   customization. Initially, the user had to do something like:
	        inoremap <C-J> <C-r>=IMAP_Jumpfunc('', 0)<CR>
	   in his .vimrc to be able to override our mapping. Now he will do
	        inoremap <C-J> <Plug>IMAP_JumpForward
	   Doing this also has the advantage that changes in IMAP_Jumpfunc() will
	   not affect the user customization.
	   NOTE: This <plug> things were inspired by looking at the excellent
	   cvscommand.vim plugin I've begun using...

2002-12-30 11:11  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages/longtable:

	. BUG: typo, env:longtable was written as enb:longtable
	  TODO: Should we write code to make such typos get handled elegantly?
	. adding modeline.

2002-12-30 03:12  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	Bug: Pressing <F5> and then pressing <enter> without choosing anything inserts
	     0 (zero)
	Cause: Tex_DoEnvironment() doesn't account for the fact that the user does not
	       choose anything. Therefore, vim by default returns zero.
	Solution: Make Tex_DoEnvironment return '' if the user hasn't chosen anything.

2002-12-30 02:54  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	Bug: When we trigger a mapping near the end of the line, things go bad.
	Cause: The "marker" or the "very improbable string" which is used by
	       IMAP_PutTextWithMovement() to mark the beginning of the left-hand side
	       contains spaces! This causes expansions near the end of a line to
	       trigger line breaks (if 'fo' contains t, which is default and tw != 0),
	       so that the marker text is broken across lines...  Havoc ensues.
	Solution: remove spaces from marker text.

2002-12-30 01:04  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/folding.vim:

	Bug: When the command TPackage was used without arguments, then the user

	Cause: Using a command
	        com! Foo normal! i<C-r>=Foo()<CR>
	       where Foo() asks for user input doesn't seem to work in vim.
	Solution: Benji suggested that we use something like:
	        com! let ret = Foo() <bar> normal! i<C-r>=ret<CR>
	        This causes the normal! command to not have to get any user input.

	TODO: There is still a bug in that the command doesn't take the user to
	insert mode... i.e, the following doesn't work:
	    com! Foo normal! i
	This command does not take the user to insert mode. However,
	    com! Foo normal! 0v$<C-g>
	does take the user to select mode...

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	. trying to collapse all the tex-supporting functions into one function
	  Tex_pack_one. This function is designed to be called via the <C-r>=
	  method. If called with one or more arguments, it will insert
	  \usepackage{} lines. Otherwise, it prompts the user to choose from
	  amongst those found in the packages/ directory.
	  TODO: As of now, this function is not amenable to being called from a
	        command.  i.e in the present version ':TPackage' doesnt work although
	        ':TPackage packname' does work.

	. The Tex_MakeSubMenu() now also takes an optional argument to filter
	  each element by an "extract" function before creating the menu item.  This
	  enables the list items to be pretty complex and the menu display itself to
	  be pretty simple

	Also a bunch of simplifications etc. This version of packages.vim should be
	fully feature compatible with the original packages.vim with the additional
	bug fixes for placeholder settings and such.

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	Bug: The mappings in latex-suite effect only the first .tex file being
	     edited.
	Cause: In a recent chage, when IMAP(lhs, rhs, ft) is called with a
	       a:ft != '', then it sets the mapping to be buffer local.  This
	       breaks latex-suite which calls the IMAP() functions only once when
	       it is first started, not for every buffer. Changing things so that
	       the mappings are called with every filetype event will be
	       1. quite time consuming
	       2. kind of inefficient in that a _lot_ of lines will need to be
	          resourced with every filetype event.

	So until a better solution presents itself, make all maps created by
	IMAP() global (not buffer-local).

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/templates.vim:

	Problem: The original mechanism did not account for the placeholder settings
	  being changed.
	Changed the templates such that the first line contains a tab delimited
	list of placeholder specifications used in the file as well as the special
	characters for computing and executing things within the templates.

	ReadTemplate() reads in these specs from the first line and
	ProcessTemplates() uses them to process the template file. This allows for
	the template maker to not have to bother with the users placeholder
	settings.

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	     Second attempt at modifying s:TexQuotes().  The renaining problem was not
	with IMAP_Jumpfunc() but with the interaction of the :imap that calls

	too bad, and it seems to work.

2002-12-22 06:12  macvimx

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	. This is a reworking of most of packages.vim in an attempt to simplify it.
	  I noticed that there was a lot of duplicated effort in a lot of functions
	  adn that the placeholder settings were not respected in a lot of places
	  by using things such as
	    normal! 'i\usepackage{...
	  instead of
	    return IMAP_PutText...

	. Created a new function Tex_MakeSubMenu which takes a comma seperated list
	  and creates a 'bunched' menu, i.e breaks up the items into groups of 20.

	. made Tex_pack_supp_menu and another function use this function.

	This is a merge from the b-newimaps branch. The branch was started when a
	need to robustify imaps.vim was felt. Before, it had a big dependence on
	"funky" characters. Since imaps.vim affected a lot of files, this commit
	has a lot of modified files.

	Briefly, it changes the <<, >> and the <a-umlaut> characters throughout
	latex-suite to 'unfunky' characters.
	<< --- <+
	>> --- +>
	<a-umlaut> --- <++>

	The syntax of IMAP and IMAP_PutTextWithMovement was also changed to accept
	2 new optional arguments which specify the placeholder characters in the
	a:rhs. This allows scriptwriters to generate long term maps which will not
	depend on the internals of imaps.vim

	The b-newimaps tip at the time of this merge has been tagged as
	b-newimaps-merge-sa-1

	   . option of not deleting the placeholder while moving.

	TODO:

	. command to erase all placeholders.

	I am going to follow up this commit with another big one renaming all the
	old Tex_IMAP()s to IMAP()s... After that, it is time to merge this branch

	     I implemented yet another new syntax for IMAP() and
	IMAP_PutTextWithMovement():

	IMAP(lhs, rhs, ft, ...)
	IMAP_PutTextWithMovement(str, ...)

	In both cases, the optinal arguments are place holders, such as "<<" and ">>".
	If not supplied, the default values "<+" and "+>" are used.  IMAP() saves
	these in script variables, which are then read by s:LookupCharacter() and
	passed to IMAP_PutTextWithMovement().

	  '+>' with the s:PlaceHolder*() variables and then calls the new
	  Imap_PutText...

	sorry for the short cvs log. I am running really late.

	NOTE: This is a work in progress. the changed version of Tex_IMAP() is not

	arguments than are needed.

	This commmit will be followed by another huge commit which is essentially
	replacing all  characters with <++>,  with <+ and so on....

	FROM HENCEFORTH:

	Use <+ and +> instead of  and

	. The solution in rev 1.2 was incomplete. Instead of using

		I'm using the latex-suite to write in Portuguese. Portuguese often has

	Solution:
	Provide new globally visible functions Tex_MathBF, Tex_MathCal and
	Tex_LeftRight. Use mapcheck() to check whether a map exists for these
	functions before mapping the alt keys to trigger them. This enables people
	who might need the alt keys for other uses to utilize this behavior and
	keep the original behavior of their alt keys.

	Example:
	In order to use some other key, (say <CTRL-c>) to use Tex_MathCal(), do the
	following

		inoremap <buffer> <silent> <C-c> <C-r>=Tex_MathCal()<CR>

	If you do not want to use this functionality at all, do something like:

		inoremap <buffer> <silent> <plug>1 <C-r>=Tex_MathCal()<CR>

	This will never trigger the map.

	Changing encoding from one locale to the next causes huge ugly screen
	flickers. Therefore only change encoding if the original encoding is not
	latin1. This will at least cause it to be smoother on machines using latin1
	encoding.

	The problem ofcourse will still be there for other locales. Therefore, look
	for a more long term solution which does not require the encoding to be
	changed back and forth with each imap execution.

	If only someone had told me at the beginning not to use ascii > 127
	characters!! I think in the next major rev, we will have to undertake a
	major overhaul of all the macros to not use any of the higher ascii
	characters. Maybe modify IMAP() to allow for multiple character placeholder
	characters... (maybe '{+' and '+}' like in cream).

	This will instantly remove all the internationalization and localization
	problems.

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages.vim:

	Changes necessary for proper working of
	Tex_pack_one: now calling :TPackage returns
	line \usepackage{choice}.

2002-12-06 15:55  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	Modification of Tex_ChooseFile() for proper work with choose
	list. Previously it didn't accept word value because it was
	calling Tex_Strntok which accepts only digital value. Now it
	uses Tex_Strntok only if Choice is '\s*\d\+\s*'. In other case
	it use GetListMatchItem from libList.vim.
	This is not possible to make different prompt than "Enter
	Choice:" because this function is called in package, template
	and macro context. Making it different would require adding
	additional argument to function. This is not much work but
	I doubt this is necessary. At the top of the list is
	information "Choose a macro", "Choose a template", "Choose
	a package".

2002-12-06 08:20  macvimx

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	1.7:Use a (local) variable s:RemoveLastHistoryItem instead of a (global)
	function SAImaps_RemoveLastHistoryItem().  Also, clean up some comment
	lines from a previous change to this file.

	NOTE: This is a changed log message using the cvs admin command.

	* compiler/tex.vim:

	. In the following error message:

	    ! some error
	    <some stuff> some more stuff
	    l.12 some error notification here...

	include 'some more stuff' as part of the error message. Initially, it was
	ignored.

	TODO: also get 'some stuff' into the error message...

2002-12-06 01:44  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	. added the function SetupHotKeys() which map <S-F1> through <S-F4> to
	  insert new environments.
	. use the g:Tex_PromptedEnvironments and g:Tex_HotKeyMaps instead of some
	  s: variables.
	. Code restucturing and cleanup.

	I found that there were many functions here which were not being used at
	all. I have removed them all. I seem to remember the Tex_AmsLatex()
	function being used for something important, but I couldnt see it being
	used anywhere, so I removed it. If someone knows where this was being used,
	let me know.

2002-12-06 01:37  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	. enable the smart key mapping functions/maps only if the user wants to.

2002-12-06 01:36  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	. added options to make the auctex inspired additions customizable.
	  1. g:Tex_PromptedEnvironments defines the environments which latex-suite
	     will ask the user to choose from when a <F5> is pressed.
	  2. g:Tex_HotKeyMappings are used in the <S-F1> through <S-F4> key
	     mappings.

	. added options to disable the smart key mappings like
	  SmartBS() etc. (they are enabled by default).

	. fixed a little documentation bug in the header of the file.

2002-12-06 01:32  srinathava

	* doc/latex-suite.txt:

	. Some grammatical mistakes in the copyright para corrected.
	. custom macros was wrongly linked to macros.

	TODO: still have to add docs about the new additions in envmacros.vim

2002-12-06 00:46  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	. moved over the smart space functions and mappings into a new file called
	  ftplugin/tex/smartspace.vim

	  I think this is the way to go as far as extending goes. We do not want to
	  keep changing core latex-suite files each time some new functionality
	  needs to be added. The ftplugin file mechanism provides a very robust way
	  to letting each module take care of redefinition, reinclusion etc.

2002-12-05 22:44  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	. removed a bug in the definition of the table macro. the caption is now
	  placed below the tabular environment and the \cation{} is no longer
	  \caption{tab:}.

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	More bug fixes from after last time. Hopefully, this is the stabilizing
	version for this feature...
	. Bug fix from last time, where for a warning, the log window would not be
	  positioned at all.
	. make going to the column a little more consistent.

2002-12-02 05:09  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	A very difficult fix for the encoding problem...

	Bug: When 'encoding' is set to utf8, then macros dont work. i.e, typing
		() results in () with the cursor placed at the end.
	Cause: The behavior of vim changes according to the current encoding.
	Solution:
		1. When latex-suite is first called, temporarily set encoding to
		   latin1, source all the files and then reset it to the original
		   value. This ensures that the scripts rely on a consistent encoding
		   scheme.
		2. Whenever we do encoding specific stuff, then switch back to latin1,
		   do our stuff and then switch back.

		This is complicated by the fact that while inserting text (using the
		Imap_PutText...() function), we need to insert the placeholders in the
		curret locale, not latin1, otherwise the user will see things like <ab>
		and <bb> instead of  and . Therefore, the jump function needs to
		account for the fact that the characters are no longer in latin1...

	TODO: Document these changes asap otherwise I will completeley forget why I
	      did what I did...

2002-11-26 22:40  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:


	A number of bug fixes and code cleanup after the last hack job. Some
	important changes:

	1. Sometimes searching in the quickfix window for other lines before
	   current line containing an error on the same line would go into an
	   infinite loop.

	2. Sometimes, when the error occurs towards the end of a long line, we get
	   something like this:
	   		l.10 ... and then there is a mistake.
	   In this case, do not use the length of the broken line but use a search
	   strategy.
	   TODO: Use a search strategy even when error line is not of the above
	   form.

	3. set nowrap in quickfix window otherwise calculation width of the
	   quickfix window is faulty.

2002-11-21 01:58  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Account for more than one error on the same line.

	TODO:
	When a latex error occurs far away from the beginning of a line, as

	This is a long line which is quite long really and here is the $\errorthingie$

	Then the corresponding line in the log file might look like

	l.26 .... here is the $\errorthingie$.

	Which causes a faulty calculation of the column number. A patter search
	approach might therefore be much more robust at column number calculations.

2002-11-20 03:09  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Implemented Carl's idea of having the log file also being shown when
	RunLaTeX() is run. This is what happens presently:

	When you press \ll, then the quickfix window with one error on each line
	opens up. Beneath the quickfix window, the log file is opened in a
	"preview" window. The display within the preview window is adjusted to
	match with the error currently being examined by the user. When the user
	moves around within the quickfix window, this display is automatically
	adjusted to keep in sync.

	When the user presses <enter> in the quickfix window, then he is taken to
	the correct line and column number of the .tex file. The column number is
	computed either from the length of the broken line after l.\d\+ in the log
	file or if we have a undefined citation, then search for the missing
	citation word...

	New functions added:

	PositionPreviewWindow() : positions the display of the log file
	UpdatePreviewWindow() : positions the display of the log file and then
	                        returns to the quickfix window.
	GotoErrorLocation() : goes to the correct line and column number of the
	                      .tex file being edited.

	TODO:
	1. multiple errors on the same line dont work. the preview window gets
	   stuck on the first error.
	2. test more robustly.
	3. Ask people about various formats of LaTeX warnings, so we can guess
	   column numbers in other situations too. As of now, only undefined
	   citations and errors are caught well. For all other kinds, we goto the
	   first column of the correct line number.

2002-11-20 02:04  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

2002-11-19 22:27  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	remove the TCTarget and TVTarget commands from main.vim. These commands are
	now issued from compiler/tex.vim

2002-11-19 22:11  srinathava

	* makefile:

	. also add in .vim files from ftplugin/tex/ directory. That directory will
	contain externally contributed packages from now on.

2002-11-19 21:53  srinathava

	* compiler/tex.vim:

	Changed the algorithm for setting &makeprg to minimize the duplication in
	here and in ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim. Therefore if
	g:Tex_DefaultTargetFormat exists, then it is assumed that that variable
	came from latex-suite, which means that TTarget exists. Therefore use that
	to set the &makeprg.

	Please take a look and see if this is better than before.
	NOTE: I will also change main.vim shortly, so that the
	TCTarget and TVTarget commands are removed from SetTexOptions, because that
	part is now being taken care of here.

2002-11-16 19:45  srinathava

	* ftplugin/tex/brackets.vim:

	Various polymorphic macros from Carl Mueller (auctex.vim)
	. <M-b> encloses the previous character in \mathbf{}
	. <M-c> is polymorphic as follows:
	    Insert mode:
	    1. If the previous character is a letter or number, then capitalize it and
	       enclose it in \mathcal{}
	    2. otherwise insert \cite{}
	    Visual Mode:
	    1. Enclose selection in \mathcal{}
	. <M-l> is also polymorphic as follows:
	    If the character before typing <M-l> is one of '([{|<q', then do the
	    following:
	      1. (<M-l>       \left(\right
	              similarly for [, |
	         {<M-l>       \left\{\right\}
	      2. <<M-l>       \langle\rangle
	      3. q<M-l>       \lefteqn{}
	    otherwise insert  \label{}

	These functions make it extremeley easy to do all the \left \right stuff in
	latex.

	Thanks to Carl Mueller for these.

2002-11-16 19:40  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	i.e, ignore lines which contain non word characters.

2002-11-16 19:38  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	. added the function TexFormatLine and TexFill from Carl Mueller. These

2002-11-16 17:01  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	. extended g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings by
		\'There were undefined references'.
		\'Citation %.%# undefined'
	  These are for ignoring undefined citations.
	  The user sets TClevel to 4 when he does want to bother with citations.
	  Document this!

2002-11-16 16:43  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	changed the Tex_itemize and such functions (the specialized environment
	functions) to all use IMAP_PutTexWithMovement(). This allows the user's
	placeholder settings to be respected and also filetype specific indentation
	to be preserved even from menus. Previously, a choice made from the menu
	used to insert the placeholders even if the user had g:Imap_UsePlaceHolders
	= 0.

	New functions SetUpEnvironmentsPrompt() and
	PromptForEnvironment() for providing a consistent prompt for the user
	input. These functions will also be used in the coming version in
	Tex_Change... so that the same prompt is used.

	General janitorial work. Code clean up and prettification.

	Please check and report any bugs.

2002-11-16 02:14  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/folding.vim:

2002-11-15 14:30  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	- replaced "" with '' wherever it was possible.
	  Vim parses each "" looking for special chars, reducing number of these
	  even if this is worth only 1/1000s (or less) per "" can be worth over
	  1s for whole lS. And 1s is looong for Vim users :) If you agree I will
	  do it for all files.
	- Removed bugs mentioned by Srinatha: wrong detection of environment
	  with <S-F5> and inserting second label. Could you describe more bugs?
	- <F5> in now "intelligent". It can recognize if it is in preamble or
	  body of the document. If in preamble takes line as an argument or asks
	  for it and inserts \usepackage{argument} line. If package is supported
	  makes appropriate corrections. If in body similar actions ar taken
	  with environment.
	- removed function s:ChangeEnvironment and shortcuts as redundant

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	Bug: 'makefile's in current directory are ignored.
	Cause: used
		if glob('makefile')
			...
	for testing whether makefile exists. However, in vim, a string evaluates to
	0 in the if test. Use
		if glob('makefile') != ''
			...
	instead.

2002-11-14 01:39  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	I merged functions proposed by Carl. Removed extensed mappings.
	Now it is

		in non empty line reads line and use word in it as name of the
	function

	<S-F5> gives menu and asks for use one of options
	<C-F5> asks for environment and changes \begin, \end tags

	I also moved stuff responsible for envs from wizardfuncs.vim to
	envmacros.vim

	Removed Tex_MenuWizard and replaced it with Tex_DoEnvironment

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	Always source texrc whether or not user texrc exists. This is because the

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	. Syntax Error!!!! I commited a syntax error! Vim's line continuation \
	  occurs at the beginning of the second line, not the end of the first
	  line!

	  Hmm... This calls for a strict regimentation. Since I do not use unix so
	  often, I will never again touch code in "if !has('win32')" blocks.
	  However, installing latex with cygwin provides a very nice unix emulation
	  of vim... so debugging those things is possible.

	  Note to self: If you are touching "if !has('win32')" blocks, then verify
	  on cygwin/latex before commiting!

2002-11-11 00:55  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texmenuconf.vim:

	. patch by Peter Wilson:

	  attempt.

2002-11-11 00:54  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	. incorporating a patch submitted by Peter Wilson, with the small change

	Fixed problem with UpdateAll. But here I see one problem. This works
	only if in file exists line \begin{document}. This is fundamental.
	IMO there is no sense in figuring out all ways of searching preamble.
	First 20 lines? If there are rich comments preamble can be much longer.
	Whole file? If this is file about latex in body of file can be line with
	\usepackage{ and menu will give information about file which noexists in
	preamble (and with weird formatting whole function may go to hell).

	escape \{} in 'makeprg'.  Default:  for win32, do not escape these characters;
	otherwise, do escape them.  I believe the resulting value for 'makeprg' is
	very robust.

2002-11-08 09:37  macvimx

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	I added g:Tex_EscapeChars, used in compiler.vim .

2002-11-08 05:39  srinathava

	* compiler/tex.vim:

	. missing space in &makeprg. (bug reported by Siegfried Bublitz).

2002-11-07 19:02  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: main.vim, texmenuconf.vim:

	doing
	    let s:up_path = substitute(s:path, "latex-suite", "", "")
	doesnt work because s:path could be of the form
	    s:path = '~/latex-suite/vimfiles/ftplugin/latex-suite'
	so that the first latex-suite is removed instead of the second.
	doing
	    let s:up_path = expand("<sfile>:p:h:h")
	is much more robust.

2002-11-07 18:04  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/templates.vim:

	. bug in ReadTemplate() function caused the TTemplate command not to function properly.
	  was trying to read in files of the form:
		templates/report_twocolumn.tex.*
	  which gives an error.

2002-11-07 14:25  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texmenuconf.vim:

	texmenuconf.vim: fixed problem with "Edit texrc" menu entry now
	1. it works
	2. gives message if private texrc doesn't exist
	3. command Ttexrc works in non-gui session

2002-11-07 03:21  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim:

	main.vim:
	1. added to SmartDots inserting \ldots outside math mode
	2. removed from "other miscellaneous stuff from imaps.vim"
	some redundant functions (secondary maps for sections and math symbols).
	Sometimes too much is just too much. Three letter system for sections
	and auctex shortcuts for math symbols seems more logical for me.

2002-11-07 03:20  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/packages/polski:

	polski: add support for ~

2002-11-06 00:37  srinathava

	* doc/latex-suite.txt:

	. moved benji from contributors list to maintainers list.

2002-11-05 09:10  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/elementmacros.vim:

	elementmacros.vim: To Various menu added \pageref and \cite

2002-11-04 14:22  srinathava

	* plugin/imaps.vim:

	Preben Randhol reports that imaps.vim adds some gratuitous general purpose
	maps, the potentially most annoying of which is the mapping for
	(). Remove the "example" mappings from imaps.vim and instead document a
	little more heavily.

	People who want to use imaps.vim for their own general purpose maps will
	now have to do something like this:
		au GuiEnter * :call IMAP(lhs, rhs, '')
	(because calling IMAP on the guienter event ensures that imaps.vim is
	already sourced).

2002-11-04 12:40  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/dictionaries/dictionary:

	dictionary: misspel emppty -> empty

2002-11-04 12:39  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/envmacros.vim:

	envmacros.vim: 1. added environments quote i quotation
	               2. fixed bug with enumeration lists (\\item)

2002-11-04 12:39  mikmach

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/elementmacros.vim:

	elementmacros.vim: I've added ref, label and footnotes elemets to menu
	X-Elements.Various.

2002-11-04 08:32  macvimx

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/: compiler.vim, texrc:

	improved defaults for Mac OSX

2002-11-04 07:39  macvimx

	* makefile, ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim,
	  ftplugin/latex-suite/main.vim, ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	makefile:  I fixed a little mistake I made
	main.vim:  I commented out "runtime compiler/tex.vim".  See further comments in the file.
	compiler.vim and texrc:  1. I added some support for Mac OSX, using
	if has('macunix') ...
	2. Instead of "--interaction=nonstopmode" I use "\nonstopmode \input{$*}"
	as in compiler/tex.vim .  Not all versions of tex support the --interaction option, so this is more robust.  Then, the "\" and "{}" have to be escaped for
	the shell.  I simplified "let &l:makeprg ..." with curly-brace variables.

2002-11-04 06:15  macvimx

	* makefile:

	I added targets to the makefile:  install, stallin (reverse install, for
	lack of a better name), and sync.  These require rsync to be installed
	(but use it only locally, like cp with lots of options).  The idea is that
	after a "cvs update" you can "make install" to put the files in your
	~/.vim directory (or another directory, using "make install VIMFILES=...").
	Then, you can edit and test the files, run "make stallin", and "cvs commit".
	If you have some changes in your local CVS directory and some in your
	vimfiles directory, you can use "make sync".

	* makefile:

	. merged the zip2tar target into the main target. Dont see why the tar.gz

	. rolled back a change which crept in during debugging.

2002-10-27 22:41  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	. use an option g:Tex_UseEditorSettingInDVIViewer
	  to specify whether we want the command for the dvi viewer to also specify
	  an external editor. defaults to 0 (i.e dont specify editor).

2002-10-27 22:40  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/compiler.vim:

	. allow an option to change the behavior of the dvi viewer command. By
	  default, only do
	    exec '!'.s:viewer.' '.mainfname.'.dvi &'
	  when an option is present, use the extended version which specifies the
	  editor.

2002-10-27 22:37  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/folding.vim:

	. changed the definition of the section fold region from
	    startpat = '^\s\\section\*\='
	  to
	    startpat = '^\s\\section\W'
	  so as to allow for things like:
	    \section[short]{Loooong title}
	  More bug fixes by Peter Heslin.
	. also allow %%fakesection to terminate \section.

2002-10-27 02:28  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/folding.vim:

	. changed the definition of \sections from
	    \section
	  to
	    \section\*\={
	  in order to
	  1. account for things like \sectionstyle not munging up things.
	  2. to account fo things like \section{ and \section*{
	. added a fold item called
	    %%fakesection
	  to allow for manual forcing of folds.

	Both suggestions by Peter Heslin.

2002-10-27 02:16  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/folding.vim:

	. added some pretty extensive comments about how to add folding. hopefully,
	some future revision will have a way of specifying folds using the texrc.

2002-10-27 02:15  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc:

	. removed the ff=unix setting from the modeline since this causes a
	  spurious modified flag for cvs.

2002-10-27 01:18  srinathava

	* ftplugin/latex-suite/wizardfuncs.vim:

	Many of the wizard functions did not use
	IMAP_PutTextWithMovement() while putting text. This caused the
	g:IMAP_UsePlaceHolder setting as well as the settings for the placeholder
	characters to be ignored.

	bug pointed out by Peter Heslin

	. repaired removal of \n from EOL in character-wise selection.
	  ( originally, the \n substitution was kinda useless ).
	. in ExecMap(), use <plug>SelectRegion to select the region. this is
	  mapped (script locally) to `<v`>. this method avoids the problem of some
	  of the characters in the string '`<v`>' being mapped by user.
	  (as is the case with us where ` is used to start the visual mode mappings
	  for fonts!)
	. some code beautification.
